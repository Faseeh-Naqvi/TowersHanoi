# Towers of Hanoi Program with Stack Implementation

This program implements the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle using a stack data structure. The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one rod to another, with the constraint that only one disk can be moved at a time and no disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Features

- **Stack-based Solution:** The program utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of the movements of the disks between the rods.

- **Interactive Interface:** The program provides an interactive interface where the user can input the number of disks and watch the step-by-step solution of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.

- **Visual Representation:** Each step of the solution is visually represented, showing the movement of disks between rods.

- **Optimal Solution:** The program ensures that it follows the optimal solution to the puzzle, minimizing the number of moves required to solve it.

## How to Use

1. **Compile:** Compile the program using your preferred programming language's compiler.

2. **Run:** Execute the compiled program.

3. **Input:** Enter the number of disks you want to use in the puzzle.

4. **Observe:** Watch as the program demonstrates the step-by-step solution, displaying the movements of disks between rods.

5. **Completion:** Once the puzzle is solved, the program will indicate the successful completion and the number of moves taken.

## Example
Number of disks: 3

```bash

## Example

```bash
$ ./towers_of_hanoi_stack
Enter the number of disks: 3

Step 1:
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C

Step 2:
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B

Step 3:
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B

Step 4:
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C

Step 5:
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A

Step 6:
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C

Step 7:
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C

Puzzle solved in 7 moves.
